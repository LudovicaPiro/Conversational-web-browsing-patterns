# Conversational-web-browsing-patterns
This is a collection of interaction patterns for conversational web browsing published in the paper [Defining Patterns for a Conversational Web](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581145)

## Method
The patterns were derived from focus groups and co-design sessions with Blind and Vision Impaired people, to capture their needs when interacting through voice through a research through design process. During the co-design sessions, participants were asked to define by themselves the conversation for browsing a website of their choice. From these sessions, observations and conversations examples were collected. Four design dimensions were extracted from the data resulting grom the studies. The conversation examples were further generalized into conversational patterns. 

## Dataset
The file compries the found patterns and their extended description. The patterns ar divided according to their corresponding design dimension. Each design dimension is also paired with an extended description.
Below an extract is shown:
| design dimension | design dimension definition | pattern 1 | description pattern 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orientation - Map of the navigable space. | Provide mechanisms for the users to understand the website structure | View in the large | The interaction with the Home Page must convey the main thematic areas and the main navigational components |
| Navigation - Intelligible and quick navigation mechanisms. | The CA should support different navigation strategies for for in-depth explorations to narrow down navigation options along the content hierarchy. | Q&A | The users must be able to formulate punctual, fast-served requests for specific content |
