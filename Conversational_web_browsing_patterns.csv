Orientation - Map of the navigable space.;Provide mechanisms for the users to understand the website structure. These mechanisms subsume a hierarchical content organization sustaining a systematic exploration through different layers.;View in the large;As soon as the user enters a website, the interaction with the Home Page must convey the main thematic areas and the main navigational components;Navigational context;Every time the user enters a new navigation node, the CA must offer information on the navigational context.;Link predictability;A preview of the content reachable through a link can help understand a-priori what the target content is about and avoid useless navigation steps.;;
Navigation - Intelligible and quick navigation mechanisms.;The CA should support different navigation strategies for for in-depth explorations to narrow down navigation options along the content hierarchy. Punctual, fast-served content requests as a help to locate desired content, along with the capability of bookmarking information nodes for direct access to the content of interest.;Q&A;The users must be able to formulate punctual, fast-served requests for specific content;Bookmarking. ;"The users must be able to bookmark nodes for later access to important pieces of information; this can be beneficial for personalizing the navigation experience and have a positive impact on orientation.";User-defined node clustering.;This is a specialization of the bookmarking pattern, which allows the users to group bookmarked sections in clusters representing thematic areas that are meaningful to them and could help them recall a navigation context;Exploration of thematic areas;"The CA assists the exploration of thematic areas present in a website by allowing the users to i) move horizontally across pages, and ii) move vertically within a page (e.g.: ""Go down to “Composition”) to reach inner layers offering further details on a given topic."
Content reading - Segmentation and summarization of page content;Content reading patterns suggest how to segment, summarize, and index the website content, and how to let the user move through the resulting conversational nodes thanks to dedicated content-reading commands. The original page content must be preserved and should be entirely accessible if the users ask for this option.;Content Segmentation;Page content can be divided into segments that the users can quickly scroll through appropriate commands.;Skimming mechanisms;Content summarization can give a preview of a section, for example when a new section is entered or when a link must be traversed and the user wants to know a-priori what can be found in the target section. It can prevent unwanted, or unneeded, content readings and navigations;Conversational tag cloud;conversational tag clouds can convey the key concepts characterizing a node's content. the CA lists tags that represent the most relevant information within the reached component.;;
Conversation control - Conversation-scaffolding intents;control the conversation through general default commands, i.e., those for invoking fallback and recovery paths and receiving help;Default actions;for invoking help, moving back and forth along the conversation steps, listening again to a CA utterance, and accessing bookmarked components.;Current status;for grasping what the CA is doing and where the reached content is located, i.e., answering questions such as “Where I came from?”, and “Where can I go from here?”;Landmark nodes;"to quickly move to a Home Page and to other components within a page that are representative of the main thematic areas. All the components labeled as landmarks are globally reachable in the page; the CA must be able to present them at any step of the conversation, upon users’ request.";;
