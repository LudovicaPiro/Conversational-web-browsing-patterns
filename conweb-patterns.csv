Design dimensions;Orientation - Map of the navigable space.;Navigation - Intelligible and quick navigation mechanisms.;Content reading - Segmentation and summarization of page content;Conversation control - Conversation-scaffolding intents
definition;Provide mechanisms for the users to understand the website structure. These mechanisms subsume a hierarchical content organization sustaining a systematic exploration through different layers.;The CA should support different navigation strategies for for in-depth explorations to narrow down navigation options along the content hierarchy.. Punctual, fast-served content requests as a help to locate desired content, along with the capability of bookmarking information nodes for direct access to the content of interest.;Content reading patterns suggest how to segment, summarize, and index the website content, and how to let the user move through the resulting conversational nodes thanks to dedicated content-reading commands. The original page content must be preserved and should be entirely accessible if the users ask for this option.;control the conversation through general default commands, i.e., those for invoking fallback and recovery paths and receiving help
Pattern 1;View in the large;Q&A;Content Segmentation;Default actions
description;As soon as the user enters a website, the interaction with the Home Page must convey the main thematic areas and the main navigational components;The users must be able to formulate punctual, fast-served requests for specific content;Page content can be divided into segments that the users can quickly scroll through appropriate commands.;for invoking help, moving back and forth along the conversation steps, listening again to a CA utterance, and accessing bookmarked components.
pattern 2;Navigational context;Bookmarking. ;Skimming mechanisms;Current status
description;Every time the user enters a new navigation node, the CA must offer information on the navigational context.;"The users must be able to bookmark nodes for later access to important pieces of information; this can be beneficial for personalizing the navigation experience and have a positive impact on orientation.";Content summarization can give a preview of a section, for example when a new section is entered or when a link must be traversed and the user wants to know a-priori what can be found in the target section. It can prevent unwanted, or unneeded, content readings and navigations;for grasping what the CA is doing and where the reached content is located, i.e., answering questions such as “Where I came from?”, and “Where can I go from here?”
pattern 3;Link predictability;User-defined node clustering.;Conversational tag cloud;Landmark nodes
description;A preview of the content reachable through a link can help understand a-priori what the target content is about and avoid useless navigation steps.;This is a specialization of the bookmarking pattern, which allows the users to group bookmarked sections in clusters representing thematic areas that are meaningful to them and could help them recall a navigation context;conversational tag clouds can convey the key concepts characterizing a node's content. the CA lists tags that represent the most relevant information within the reached component.;"to quickly move to a Home Page and to other components within a page that are representative of the main thematic areas. All the components labeled as landmarks are globally reachable in the page; the CA must be able to present them at any step of the conversation, upon users’ request."
patter 4;;Exploration of thematic areas;;
description;;"The CA assists the exploration of thematic areas present in a website by allowing the users to i) move horizontally across pages, and ii) move vertically within a page (e.g.: ""Go down to “Composition”) to reach inner layers offering further details on a given topic.";;
